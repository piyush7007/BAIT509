Answer 1:
We can say for A the likelyhood of the person to have productive score of 75 is 0.4, and for B the likelyhood is 0.1 to have productive 
score of 75. Density is the likelyhood, or our belief. A has low variance, B has a lot of variance.

Answer 2:
We will choose candidate B, as even if the productivity has high variance but the worst case is always better than candidate A, which is 60. 

Answer 3:
The probabilist forecast is centred around the 0 response with probability od 0.4, but according to the the test data the graph should be 
skewed more towards 2 and not 0.

Class notes:::

0.9 - quantile = 100m3/s
only 10 percent chance that flow will be more than 100 m3/s, so in some cases high quantiles are useful

mean is necesary if we have to predict the average of the car, whenever we want to total.
